SELECT a.name, w.channel, COUNT(*)
FROM accounts a
JOIN web_events w
ON a.id = w.account_id AND a.id =  (SELECT id
                     FROM (SELECT a.id, a.name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) tot_spent
                           FROM orders o
                           JOIN accounts a
                           ON a.id = o.account_id
                           GROUP BY a.id, a.name
                           ORDER BY 3 DESC
                           LIMIT 1) inner_table)
