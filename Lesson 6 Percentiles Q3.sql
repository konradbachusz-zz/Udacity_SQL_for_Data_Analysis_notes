/*Use the NTILE functionality to divide the orders for each account into 100 levels in terms of the amount of total_amt_usd for their orders. Your resulting table should have the account_id, the occurred_at time for each order, the total amount of total_amt_usd paper purchased, and one of 100 levels in a total_percentile column.*/
